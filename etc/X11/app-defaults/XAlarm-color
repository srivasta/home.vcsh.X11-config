! We can't surround this by "#ifdef COLOR ... #endif" and have it in'
! .../lib/X11/app-defaults/XAlarm because stuff in there is not pre-processed
! with cpp like wot xrdb does.  Now why is that...?

! If you want colour, you have to stick this in your ~/.xresources file (where
! you can surround it with #ifdefs).
